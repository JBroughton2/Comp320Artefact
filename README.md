# Artefact Contents

Artefact contains three dungeon layouts filled with assorted items to make them feel less empty, there is aslo a fourth scene where the actual tool is used.
The three seperate scenes will be used in the experiment to test whether or not players can tell when something is procedurally generated and if so, what gives it away?
There is also a first person controller created by me used for the level navigation, however, players can switch to a top down view anytime by pressing the **F** key.

## Artefact State

The artefact is currently in its release state and has been sent out in the questionnaire for people to test.

There are currently no known bugs that could jeperdise the experiment and therefore no need to edit the project.
